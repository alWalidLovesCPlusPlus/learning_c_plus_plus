Dhaka Metro Rail is a new transportation system being built in Dhaka,
Bangladesh to solve the cityâ€™s traffic and air pollution problems.

The entire metrorail, known as MRT Line-6, opened on November 4, 2023.
It allows passengers to travel 20 km from Uttara to Motijheel in just 38 minutes.
The metro rail will cover about 23 kilometers and have 16 stops.
It is expected to be finished by 2026 and will make traveling easier and faster for people.

The government of Bangladesh and Japan are working together to build this project,
which will also be environmentally friendly by using renewable energy.

When more people use the train, there will be fewer cars and buses on the road under the metro rail.
This will save time and reduce fuel and maintenance costs.
Overall, Dhaka Metro Rail will be a modern and helpful addition to the city.
