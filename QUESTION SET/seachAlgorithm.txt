1. given sorted integers an array. find the first and last 
   index of the given elem 'x' in that array. if not found
   return -1,-1
   example : {1,2,2,3,4} where x = 2;
   ans : first : 1, second : 2
2. a rotated sorted array is a sorted array on which rotation
   operation has been performed some number of times. given a
   rotated sorted array, find the index of the minimum element 
   in the array. follow 0-based-indexing ( all the elements 
   eill be unique )
