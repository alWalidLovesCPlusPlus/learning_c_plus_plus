1. given a head of an linked list, delete all the alternative element from the linked list 
   example : 1 2 3 4 5 
   ans     : 1 3 5
2. given a head of an sorted linked list, delete all the duplicates such that all the elements appears once 
   return the linked list sorted as well
3. Traversing a linked list in reversed order
4. reversing a linked list
5. reverse the linked list kth time and return it 
   example : 1 2 3 4 5 is k is 2
             2 1 4 3 5
6. given 2 linked lists, tell wheather they are equal or not, they will be only equal if the values are
   same in the same node position
   example : 1 2 3
             1 2 3 
             ans : true
             1 2 3 3
             1 3 2 2 
             ans : false
             1 2 3 4
             1 2 
             ans : false
7. given the heads of 2 linked lists head1 and head2, return the node at which the two linked list
   intersects. if there is no head is found return NULL;
8. given the head of a linked list, remove the k-th node from the end of the list and returns its head.
