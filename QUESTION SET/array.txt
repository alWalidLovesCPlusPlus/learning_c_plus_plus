1. => sort an array consisting of number and can be string ( bubble , insertion, selection, merge )
2. => given an array consisting of only 0 and 1. you have to tell how many 1 are presented the most sequentally
3. => given an array of numbers, 'i' and 'j' are also given, print the sum 'i' to 'j';
4. target sum : 
        (a)=> find the total numbers of pairs in the
        array whose sum is equal to 'x'(given)
        (b)=> find the total numbers of triplets in the
        array whose sum is equal to 'x'(given)
        (c)=> finding a unique number in an array
        (d)=> find the second largest value in an array
        (e)=> rotate the array by 'x' steps where 'x'
        is positive and (k>n)
        (f)=> solve the 'e number question' with vector
5. two pointers : 
        (a)=> sort an array consisting of only 0 and 1
        (b)=> given an array of int 'a' move all the 
        even int at the starting of the array followed
        by all odd integers. The relative order of odd
        or even int doesn't matter.
        (c)=> given an integer array 'a' sorted in asending order,
        return an array of the squres of each number sorted in 
        asending order (+ and -)
6. prefix sum : 
        (a) => given an array, return the prefix sum ( without creating a nre array )
        (b) => check if we can partition the array into two sub 
        arrays with equal sum
        (c) => 'n' size array. answer 'q' queries where you need to 
        print the sum of values in a given range of indices from 'l' to 'r'
7. Array One Shot : 
         (a) => given two vectors, merge them
         (b) => given an sorted array find is there is any pair
         whose sum is exactly equal to 'x'(given)
         (c) => given an sorted array find is there is any pair
         whose absolute difference is exactly equal to 'x'(given)
         (d) => given a sorted vector, find the number of 
         unique pairs and their absolute sum as 'x' 
         and how many pairs
8. 2D array : 
         (a) => pascal triangle : (i) nth elem
                                  (ii) nth row
                                  (iii) print nth rows
         (b) => given a sorted 2d array tell which row has the
         maximum '1'. consisting of only 0 and 1
9. given two array make 'Union Set' 
10. sorting algorithm questions : 
         (a) => given an array consisting of 0 and other numbers
         move all the 0 to the begining without breaking relative 
         order
         (b) => sort a string-array 'with fruit names'
         (c) => write a code to find the kth smallest element in an
         array
         (d) => sort an array consisting of only 0,1,2
         (e) => given 2sorted array merge them in a sorted manner
